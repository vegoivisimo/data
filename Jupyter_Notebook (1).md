# Final Project - Data Science Tools and Ecosystem




## Introduction
In this notebook, we will summarize some of the key tools and concepts learned during the Data Science course. We will cover programming languages, libraries, tools, and perform basic arithmetic operaions using code cells.






## Data Science Languages  
Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:  
1. Python  
2. R  
3. SQL  
4. Julia  
5. Scall



## Data Science Libraries  
Some commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:  
1. Pandas  
2. NumPy  
3. Matlib  
4. Scikit-learn  
5. TensorFlow




## Data Science Tools  

| Tool           | Description                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| JupyterLab     | Interactive development environment |
| RStudio        | IDE for R                         |
| Apache Zeppelin| Notebook for big data analytics   |
| VS Code        | Lightweight code editor           |





## Examples of Arithmetic Expressions  
Below are some examples of simple arithmetic expressions:  
- Addition: `3 + 5`  
- Multiplication: `4 * 6`  
- Division: `10 / 2`  
- Combined: `(5 + 2) * 3`




# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add numbers
```python
(3 * 4) + 8
````



# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
```python
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
````


# Objectives for this notebook
```python
objectives = [
    "List popular languages in Data Science",
    "List commonly used libraries",
    "Introduce Data Science tools",
    "Perform arithmetic operations using code",
    "Share notebook via GitHub"
]
for obj in objectives:
    print("-", obj)
````
