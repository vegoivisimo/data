## Data Science Tools  

| Tool           | Description                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| JupyterLab     | Interactive development environment |
| RStudio        | IDE for R                         |
| Apache Zeppelin| Notebook for big data analytics   |
| VS Code        | Lightweight code editor           |

## Examples of Arithmetic Expressions  
Below are some examples of simple arithmetic expressions:  
- Addition: `3 + 5`  
- Multiplication: `4 * 6`  
- Division: `10 / 2`  
- Combined: `(5 + 2) * 3`
```


```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add numbers
(3 * 4) + 8
```


```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
```


```python
# Objectives for this notebook
